### General Remarks
You are welcome to contribute code to the UI5 Web Components in order to fix bugs or to implement new features.

There are three important things to know:

1. You must be aware of the Apache License (which describes contributions) and **agree to the Contributors License Agreement**. This is common practice in major Open Source projects. To make this process as simple as possible, we are using *[CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/)* for individual contributions. CLA assistant is an open source tool that integrates with GitHub very well and enables a one-click experience for accepting the CLA. For company contributors, special rules apply. See the respective section below for details.
2. Follow our **[Development Conventions and Guidelines](/docs/Guidelines.md)**.
3. **Not all proposed contributions can be accepted**. Some features may just fit a third-party add-on better. The code must match the overall direction of the UI5 Web Components and improve it. So there should be some "bang for the byte". For most bug fixes this is a given, but a major feature implementation first needs to be discussed with one of the committers. Possibly, one who touched the related code or module recently. The more effort you invest, the better you should clarify in advance whether the contribution will match the project's direction. The best way would be to just open an enhancement ticket in the issue tracker to discuss the feature you plan to implement (make it clear that you intend to contribute). We will then forward the proposal to the respective code owner. This avoids disappointment.

### Contributor License Agreement
When you contribute code, documentation, or anything else, you have to be aware that your contribution is covered by the same [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that is applied to the UI5 Build and Development Tooling itself.

In particular, you need to agree to the Individual Contributor License Agreement, which can be [found here](https://gist.github.com/CLAassistant/bd1ea8ec8aa0357414e8). This applies to all contributors, including those contributing on behalf of a company.

If you agree to its content, you simply have to click on the link posted by the CLA assistant as a comment in the pull request. Click it to check the CLA, then accept it on the following screen if you agree to it. The CLA assistant saves this decision for upcoming contributions to that repository and notifies you, if there is any change to the CLA in the meantime.

#### Company Contributors
If employees of a company contribute code, in **addition** to the individual agreement mentioned above, one company agreement must be submitted. This is mainly for the protection of the contributing employees.

A company representative authorized to do so needs to download, fill in, and print the [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](/docs/SAP%20Corporate%20Contributor%20License%20Agreement.pdf) form and then proceed with one of the following options:

- Scan and e-mail it to [opensource@sap.com](mailto:opensource@sap.com) and [openui5@sap.com](mailto:openui5@sap.com)
- Fax it to: +49 6227 78-45813
- Send it by traditional letter to:  
  *Industry Standards & Open Source Team*  
  *Dietmar-Hopp-Allee 16*  
  *69190 Walldorf*  
  *Germany*

The form contains a list of employees who are authorized to contribute on behalf of your company. When this list changes, please let us know.
