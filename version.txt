    * refactor: reduce bundle size
    
    - strip down Device.js by leaving only browser, os, system and touch objects
    - remove default locale fallback from LocaleData.js as we always fetch it separately
    - add setupSystem, use it for both html and shadow root spans
    - 8 KB minzip reduction
