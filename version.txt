    fix: fix source maps (#181)
    
    Template files with DOS line endings are breaking the source map.
    Convert DOS line endings to Unix line endings when generating renderers.
    This way, .hbs files with DOS line endings (no eslint) will not break the source
    maps as the generated renderer will have the correct line ending.
    The change is also correcting the line endings of existing .hbs templates.
