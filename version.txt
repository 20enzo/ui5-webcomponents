    fix: fix broken translations (#548)
    
    when a locale other than english is selected, the missing core-shim.js
    import was causing the wrong locale to be used by the
    core/ResourceBundle
    now with adding the Core-shim.js import, all resource bundles
    will have the correct locale at run time
