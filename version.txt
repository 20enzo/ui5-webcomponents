     fix: fix "ifDefined" to update DOM only when attrs are changed (#415)
    
    * Background: "ifThruthy" removes an attribute key and value if value is falsy, but it makes the templates less efficient, as lit-html updates attributes no matter, if the value is changed which causes some issues.
    * Fixes: https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/issues/401
    * Changes:
    * Rename "ifThruthy" to "ifDefined" and correct the directive logic to update only if the result of the directive is different from the previous value.
    * Attributes undefined, null and empty strings are removed from DOM.
    * Remove obsolete "common" partials
    * Make use of boolean props syntax in lit-html
    * Fix  default value for string props, the default becomes empty string or the the value, given via the defaultValue metadata key.
    * Clean templates from non-existing component properties (tooltip, dir..)
    * Remove type: "Active" everywhere the ui5-li is used, as it is "Active" by default
