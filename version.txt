    docs: better explain slot usage (#594)
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: the "data-ui5-slot" attribute is deprecated. Use "slot" instead.
    All slots can accept multiple child nodes now. Several web components can now accept
    text in addition to HTML elements. See the documentation for details about individual web components.
