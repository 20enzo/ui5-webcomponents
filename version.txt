    Closes: https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/issues/313
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: 'selectedIndex' property is removed. Instead use 'selected' property of the Tab

    inline mode
    BREAKING CHANGE: 'headerBackgroundDesign' property is removed
    BREAKING CHANGE: 'backgroundDesign' property is removed

    BREAKING CHANGE: 'TabContainerDensityMode' is deleted. To set different size modes use ?sap-ui-compactSize=true
    BREAKING CHANGE: Tab's 'design' property is removed
    BREAKING CHANGE: Tab's 'count' property is removed. Instead use the additional-text property
