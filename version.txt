    fix: prevent dual event dispatching in no conflict mode (#363)
    
    - all controls should now listen for prefixed events ui5-*
    - all test run with no conflict setting, therefore test pages should interact with ui5-* events
    - both events are now dispatched in normal mode
    - in no conflict mode - just the prefixed event is dispatched
