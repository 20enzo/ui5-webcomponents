    refactor(ui5-radiobutton): improve group handling (#348)
    
    * Added new property "name", which replaces the property "group" (removed with this change)
    * When selection changes within the group by user interaction - single "select" event is being fired and
    the newly selected radio button is the event target.
    * if more than one radio buttons within a group is set as selected, the last one is effectively selected.
    * if  a ui5-radiobutton is added to a new group, the single selection rule would be applied.
    * if the selected state is programatically changed, the single selection rule is applied and no event is fired.
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: the property "group" is replaced by the "name" property.
