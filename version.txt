    improvement: inline theme imports (#88)
    
    - generate a -css.js file for each imported .less file
    - this file exports the generated CSS as a string value
    - rewrite the imports from .less to -css.js
    - more compatible for build tools as these files are supposed to be
      inlined anyway and no longer force a json configuration at build time
      which makes it easier for less capable build tools.
