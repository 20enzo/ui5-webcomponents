    improvement: externalise webcomponents polyfill (#185)
    
    The polyfill is now loaded via the official webcomponents-loader, instead of imports
    This allows users of web components to provide their own version and copy of the polyfill
    This also decreases the bundle size for the playground for modern browsers.
