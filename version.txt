    chore: rewrite imports with file extensions (#344)
    
    Rewrite all imports across all packages (core, base and main) with file extensions
    and force writing them this way by adding an eslint rule.
    Example:
    import WebComponent from "@ui5/webcomponents-base/src/WebComponent.js";
    import ButtonRenderer from "./build/compiled/ButtonRenderer.lit.js";
    import buttonCss from "./themes/Button.css.js";
    * Packages are ignored: import { render } from "lit-html";
    * The eslint rule is: "import/extensions": ["error", "ignorePackages"]
