    fix(ui5-input): fire change in sync with the native input (#168)
    
    Bind for the native input change to fire the ui5-input semantic one.
    Make sure change event is fired upon suggestion item selection.
    Still, for IE, a manually work is needed to detect if  change should be fired
    on Enter as the native input does not react.
