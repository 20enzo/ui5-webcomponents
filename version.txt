    fix(ui5-button): removes active state after tabbing on an pressed button (#335)
    
    - The activate state of the buttons used to be displayed and controlled by the :active CSS selector. Seems like :active has some issues on different browsers and it is not consistently implemented. Therefore, the active state is now controlled by a javascript implementation.
