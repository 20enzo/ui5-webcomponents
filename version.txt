    refactor(ui5-tabcontainer): item selection and itemSelect event (#83)
    
    The following changes are applied:
    
    * remove the selectedKey property
    * remove the key property
    * introduce selectedIndex to substitute selectedKey and key pair for selection purposes
    * change itemSelect event param to provide the selected item, instead of
      the tab container internal key to make app development easier.
      Furthermore, in React, the key is reserved for the purpose of VDOM optimisations.
    * start firing itemSelect when item is selected from the overflow menu as well.
    * add simple interaction test
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: The TabContainer "selected-key" and Tab "key" properties are removed. Use TabContainer "selectedIndex" property (selected-index attribute) to set and get the selected tab.
