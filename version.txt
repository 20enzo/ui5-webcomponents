    refactor(ui5-timeline): change timestamp property to subtitleText (#321)
    
    Closes: https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/issues/299
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: 'timestamp' and 'timeFormat'  properties are removed.
    Instead use subtitle-text property and directly format the text as
    desired.
