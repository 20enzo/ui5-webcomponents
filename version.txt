    feat(ui5-shellbar): menuItems slot and menuItemPress event (#317)
    
    - menuItems renders list items in a popover which is might be open by clicking the primary title
    - menuItemPress is fired when a menu item is pressed
    - if no menu items are defined - no arrow down is rendered next to the primary title
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: titlePress event is removed and replaced by menuItems slot.
