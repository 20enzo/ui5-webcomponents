    fix: disable click events for disabled ui5-button (#586)
    
    add pointer-events: none to host component so in case it is disabled,
    the browser does not call click handlers registered to it.
    
    add chai for better assertion messages
    
    * move click handler to shadow dom
    this way, the component can handle the click first and then the app handler
    will have the correct component state in its click handler
    
    * remove event-related qunit tests
    With click handlers registered in the shadow dom, the qunit tests
    can no longer simulate events correctly.
    For these scenarios, the wdio tests will be used anyway.
    
    * fix ie11 mousedown problem in IE11
    remove disabled check, CSS takes care of that
    
    Fixes: #572
