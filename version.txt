    improvement: switch default icon font usage to CDN (#114)
    
    - loading the SAP-icons font files via ES6 imports forces the usage of
    bild tools and plugins
    - switch to CDN loading (from ui5.sap.com) so imports of most components
    are plain JS imports
    - add the icon fonts as data urls exported by ES6 modules for users
    who want to opt out of CDN but still use JS-only imports
    - font files can still be imported by developers as assets and they can
    still use plugins to load them as URL by their builder
    - add method to override default loading location for above two cases
