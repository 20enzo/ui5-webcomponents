    refactor(base): improve bundle size (#161)
    
    - configuration set from url or json script
    - locale is required for all controls that need it,
    not on central level as it used to be
    - new module LocaleProvider is added - it returns the set
    locale from the configuration or locale based on browser
    - all compatibility core-shim and jquery levels are moved to
    Calendar and DatePicker
