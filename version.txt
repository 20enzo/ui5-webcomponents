     fix(ui5-radiobutton): fix touch area size (#445)
    
    * correct touch area size and outer circle radius, according to the latest Fiori 3 spec
    * correct outer circle width, based on the valueState
    * declare aria-readonly as standard attribute (not boolean) as
    JAWS does not announce readonly, if just aria-readonly is present,
    but it is fine if aria-readonly="true"
    * add keyboard handling section
    * FIXES: https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/issues/443
