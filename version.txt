    fix: switch theme for single imported components (#356)
    
    When importing a single component like show in the documentation,
    the url parameters for setting a theme stopped working,
    unless a ThemePropertiesProvider module is also imported.
    
    This change returns the previous behaviour, where the single
    imports have all features working.
