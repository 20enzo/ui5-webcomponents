    feat: add data-ui5-compact-size attribute to root when compact is set (#382)
    
    - in order to have easier styling of the sizes of the components all the css
    should be applied to the root of the element (such as width, height, etc).
    - when having a compact size setting applied, all components should change their sizes, in
    order to track this change in the css we add a private data attribute to the root of each element
