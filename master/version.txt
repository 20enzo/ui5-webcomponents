    refactor: improve tabbable elements detection (#865)
    
    FIXES: #858
    
    Refactor FocusHelper.js (used to export a class previously) as follows:
    (1) All logic, related to finding focusable elements is just split (without changes) to:
    
    util/FocusableElements.js
    util/isNodeClickable.js
    util/isNodeHidden.js
    (2) The logic, related to finding tabbable elements is refactored, considering the issues we have
    that not all child elements have been traversed and slotted nodes have not been traversed via the shadow DOM order:
    
    util/TabbableElements.js
    util/isNodeTabbable.js
    Add test for tab handling in the ListItem
