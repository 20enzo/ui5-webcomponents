    feat(ui5-textarea): add "valueState" property (#1411)
    
    The property works as in the ui5-input, with one note:
    If maxlength property is set, the component turns into "Warning" state once the characters exceeds the limit.In this case, only the "Error" state is considered and can be applied.
