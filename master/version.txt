    fix(ui5-responsive-popover): set z-index on phone (#1303)
    
    **Issue**
    - when a component, that opens a dialog on phone, such as Select, DatePicker, ComboBox, MultiComboBox is opened within Dialog, it remains invisible, because the Dialog remains on top.
    
    - when such component opens a dialog on phone, all icons on the page are visible, but should not
    
    **Solution**
    set z-index on the ui5-responsive-popover tag (on desktop it relies on the ui5-popover to handle that)
