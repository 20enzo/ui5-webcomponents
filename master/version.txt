    feat(ui5-daterange-picker): enhance keyboard handling (#2179)
    
    Depending on the caret symbol position, the corresponding date gets incremented
    or decremented with one unit of measure by using the following keyboard
    combinations:
    [PAGEDOWN] - Decrements the corresponding day of the month by one
    [SHIFT] + [PAGEDOWN] - Decrements the corresponding month by one
    [SHIFT] + [CTRL] + [PAGEDOWN] - Decrements the corresponding year by one
    [PAGEUP] - Increments the corresponding day of the month by one
    [SHIFT] + [PAGEUP] - Increments the corresponding month by one
    [SHIFT] + [CTRL] + [PAGEUP] - Increments the corresponding year by one
    
    Fixes #1534
