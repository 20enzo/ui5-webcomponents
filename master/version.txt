    refactor(components): rename event names to kebab case (#1692)
    
    Rename all components event names that are currently camelCase to kebab-case, but keep the camelCase events firing for backward compatibility for at least one release to allow smooth migrations of the applications.
    
    BREAKING_CHANGE: all event names are renamed from camelCase to kebabCase.
    **Examples**: "selectionChange" becomes "selection-change", "itemClose" becomes "item-close",
    "afterOpen" becomes "after-open", etc.
