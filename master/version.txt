    fix(build): escape quotes in translation texts (#1511)
    
    **Background**
    The Translation Delivery pull request fails and I found out that one of the new texts in messagebundle_en.properties has has quoted word  `Drop files to upload them or use the "Upload" button `.
    
    **Issue:**
    Later when building the i18n-defaults.js, the following fails:
    
    ```js
    // effectiveValue  has double quotes itself and a word inside with double quotes in addition
    return `const ${key} = {key: "${key}", defaultText: "${effectiveValue}"};`;
    ```
    
    **Solution**: escaping those quotes.
