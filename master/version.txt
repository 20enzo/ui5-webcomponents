    chore: add  sap_belize_hcw switch, public imports and other stuff (#1384)
    
    - add sap_belize_hcw switch
    - provide public imports for the newly added components
    - unify type naming - in most of the places we use "boolean" and "string", but in several palces we can see "Boolean" and "String"
