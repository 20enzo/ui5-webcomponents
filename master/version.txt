    fix(ui5-list): fire itemClick after the selection (#1618)
    
    We used to fire the "itemClick" and "itemPress" before the selection finishes and if someone gets the "event.detail.item.selected" - it is will be the old one.
    Now, they are fired after the selection finishes and provide the correct "item" state, although it is not common to listen for  "itemClick" in selection modes, but rather for "selectionChange".
