    fix(framework): Fix openui5 css varaibles detection (#1933)
    
    Change the regex to detect the openui5 CSS variables properly as from 1.79 the CSS Variables filename has changed to css_variables.css (previously css-varaibles.css with dash).
    But, the script will match the old name with "-" dash as well, if we need to support it, otherwise we can leave "_" only to support the latest name.
    
    FIXES: #1932
