    fix(ui5-button): determine icon-only ignoring comment nodes (#1679)
    
    We used to set icon-only if there are no childNodes, but in this case there are child nodes, because the comments are child nodes. Some styles, that rely on having a text are applied and the button does not look right, the icon is not centred as the button is wider than it should.
