    chore(ui5-date-*): make width customizable (#2223)
    
    Until now the user can not set a DateRangePicker, DateTimePicker to a width smaller than 15rem, as 15 rem is their min-width.
    Now we enable that by making the min-width propagated from the host to inner input.
    
    FIXES: #2194
