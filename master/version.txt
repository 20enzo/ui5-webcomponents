    fix: fix Item Navigation cycling (#985)
    
    **Background**
    By default the focus (managed by ItemNavigation) does not cycle trough the items, which turned out that has not been working.
    **Root Cause**
    We check for the `cycle` config when border cases are reached (first or last item), but the only thing we do is to fire a private event ("_borderReach"), but updating the index, so it actually makes a whole loop (cycle).
    **Fix**
    In these border cases we just update the internal index to `0` (when "top" border is reached) and `items.length-1` (when "bottom" border is reached).
