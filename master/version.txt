    fix(ui5-link): fix "click twice" issue in Safari (#1799) (#1800)
    
    The usage of pseudo elements such as ::after, ::before has side effects on iOs/macOS making the first click to just focus the element and the second to be registered as click. Now, we set the focus with outline, instead of pseudo element. Note: in IE, the focus will be 1px wider on all sides, compared to Safari, Chrome and FF as the outline-offset is not supported.
