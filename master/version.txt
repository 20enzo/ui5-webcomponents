    fix(framework): CSS Vars in Static Styles work on IE11 (#1440)
    
    The `createComponentStyleTag` method did not take into account Static Area CSS and did not inject it in the head. Instead, this CSS went to the `ui5-static-area-item` like on normal browsers. However, it wasn't processed there so CSS vars were not replaced.
    The fix:
     - Do not inject any CSS in `_updateFragment` for IE11 (if `shadyDOM` is `true`).
     - Inject the static area CSS along with the normal CSS in `createComponentStyleTag` instead, where it will be processed like the regular CSS
     - Finally, add a static getter for static area CSS in `UI5Element.js` to ensure it's always a string.
