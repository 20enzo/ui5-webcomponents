    fix(ui5-shellbar): enable items keyboard handling (#1473)
    
    All ui5-icon elements now become ui5-button, the ui5-button has tabindex=0 and also can be triggered with SPACE and ENTER. To ensure the correct tab order, the layout of the items is changed in such way that their DOM order is the same as their display order.
