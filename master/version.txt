    refactor: i18n build and ResourceBundle  (#720)
    
    * remove USED_KEYS.txt as we have the i18n-defaults.js auto generated.
    * remove i18n-transform.sh script as we get the translations process setup and will receive translations regularly.
    * remove all src/messagebundle_*.json files, before produced with i18n-transform.sh
    * new i18n build, based on the messagebundle_en.properties files, generating JSON files for all languages
    Example:
    messagebundle_en.json => {CARD_LABEL: "card", SWITCH_ON: "On", SWITCH_OFF: "Off"}
    * refactor greatly the base/ResourceBundle, which does not import core/ResourceBundle anymore
    * reuse only the following methods: formatMessage, normalize, nextFallbackLocale
    update the MessageBundleAssets.js to import the generated jsons.
