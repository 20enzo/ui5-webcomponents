    fix(ui5-timepicker): prevent setting valueState="Error" on empty value
    
    - Fixes the issue: when the user clears the input of the TimePicker, value-state="Error' is set, but should not as empty value is allowed and valid (this is how it works in openui5). And, the user also gets "change" event and he/she always can set  "Error" state when encounter an empty value.
    - Refactors the TimePicker tests entirely, as they used to depend on some hardcoded ids that change whenever we add new TimePicker components in the test page.
