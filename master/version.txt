    refactor(ui5-li): switchÂ§ focus styling via state (#1089)
    
    Add private property "focused" to apply the focus styling, even when the component is not on focus. This will allow the implementation of complex UX requirements related to the Combobox and MiltiCombobox, where the actual focus remains in the input field, but the visual moves between the items.
