    feat(ui5-popover): prevent closing when no opener (#1911)
    
    The change is related to the Quick View topic and affects the Input, InputSuggestions and Popover, and enables the following behaviour: (1) open an additional Popover from a suggestion on mouseover and suggestion-item-preview events, (2) to move the focus in that Popover, (3) to keep it open without a visible opener, and (4) the ability to get back via ESC.
    Add parameter to the openBy method to prevent the popover from closing when its opener is not visible anymore
    and use the old placement when the opener is gone (by default the popover would go to the top-left most corner).
    Add public method Popup.prototype.applyFocus (the logic has been extracted from applyInitialFocus) that focuses the first focusable element inside the Popup
    Change the focus retaining logic in Input/InputSuggestions as follows: returns the focus to the input field only when a suggestion is selected by the user, in other cases - does not, because otherwise focusing another popover would not be possible as the Input keeps getting focus again and again.
    Previously it was not possible to use the "close" params with the ResponsivePopover, now it forwards them to the Popover.
    Create a test page to show the entire flow
