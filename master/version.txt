    feat(ui5-panel): enable configuring the heading level (#1504)
    
    **Background**
    Our native title used to be "h1", which is indeed wrong. In openui5 it is "h2" and it is not configurable. But, in the related issue the author wants to be able to change the title level in general. Although we provide the possibility of a custom header, the author is asking for this feature to make use of the fact that the the entire native header is clickable and focusable, which is not the case with the custom one.
    **Options**
    So, we either reject this and (1) hardcode it to "h2" as in openui5, (2) introduce a property as in this change, or (3) make another slot for the title, but then we will have the current "header" slot and "headerTitle" slot and it might be confusing.
    **In this change:**
    - [refactoring] Use div with role="heading" and "aria-level" attrs, instead of "h" tag to  enable the configuration of the level. Reuse the existing TitleLevel enum ("H1" to "H6") and extract the number part, but AriaLevel type ("1" - "6") is also an option.
    - [FIX] sync the parameters in the latest visual design and change few variables
    - [FIX] title now truncates, previously it used to wrap.
