    feat(ItemNavigation): introduce navigationMode property (#910)
    
    (1) The ItemNavigation now has three navigation modes:
    - "Vertical" - "Up|Down" navigation
    - "Horizontal"- "Left|Right" navigation
    - "Auto" - both "Vertical" and "Horizontal" navigation
    
    (2) From now you can navigate throw the List items and Table rows only vertically
    via the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys.
