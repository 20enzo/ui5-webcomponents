    refactor: align all inputs to use same CSS for styling (#793)
    
    - all input like elements such as Input, MultiComboBox, Select use the same CSS for styling host
    - all icons than needs to be styled as input icons have a common CSS - InputIcon.css
    - users can now overstyle all input elements by setting styles to host
    - fixes tiny bug in Select when Picker is open - icon background color should be pressed
    - adds a better keyboard handling for MultiComboBox
