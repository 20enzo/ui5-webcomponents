    feat(ui5-toast): introduce new component (#1014)
    
    New ui5-toast component is introduced.
    
    Sample changes:
    More samples are added in the playground, which demonstrate default
    Toast, as well as some short/long duration options for the component.
    Also the script for the handlers in now simplified/shortened in both
    playground and test pages.
    
    Style changes:
    Added "--_ui5_toast_background" and "--_ui5_toast_shadow" CSS parameters.
    Font-family, color, and font-size of the "ui5-toast-text" are now on the
    host.
    These changes give the web-component user, the freedom to alter
    the styling of the Toast.
    
    CSS class name changes:
    The "ui5-toast-root-parent" class is now renamed to "ui5-toast-root".
    The "ui5-toast-root" class is now called "ui5-toast-content".
    
    Animation changes:
    The transition (fade out animation) is now handled differently.
    It is still a third of the Toast's duration property, but if
    it happens to be more than 1000ms, we force it to be 1000ms.
    This way we omit prolonged fade out times, when
    the duration property is longer, than 3000ms (default).
    
    Tests changes:
    Spec files are now aligned with the new transition behaviour.
    Also some new tests are now added in order to cover mose cases.
    
    Now if the user inputs duration lower than 500ms, we
    force it to be 500ms.
    
    Additionally the following changes are made:
    
    * CSS variables are now aligned with the new convention.
    
    * Toast's text styling is now part of the ui5-toast-content class.
    
    * A span which is the container of the Toast's text
    is now removed from the hbs.
    
    * One of the Toasts in the html sample is now with invalid duration "-1".
    This is in order to test if the minimum duration is applied correctly.
    
    * Added test in the spec file, which tests the new minimum duration behaviour.
    
    * The sample.html is reduced in volume.
