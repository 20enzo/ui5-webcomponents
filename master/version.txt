    chore(ui5-side-navigation): subitems may have icons, appenddocs fixed (#2037)
    
    Now we support icon on the subitem, but strongly recommend not to to be used as suggested by the Fiori 3 guidelines. The icons on the second level are removed from the sample. The JSDOC has been improved.
    
    FIXES: #2033
