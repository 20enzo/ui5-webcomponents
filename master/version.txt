    refactor(ui5-checkbox): enable aria-label forwarding (#1686)
    
    The user now can set an aria-label on the component tag, it will be set on the root element with role="checkbox" and read by the screen readers. This feature is also useful for components that internally use checkbox such as the ListItem, that now can provide aria-label to the CheckBox in MultiSelect mode to meet the ACC requirements for having an accessible name.
    
    FIXES: #1664
