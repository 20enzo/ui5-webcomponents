    refactor(ui5-tabcontainer): provide tabIndex in tabSelect even
    
    The tab index is provided as event details and don't have to be calculated by users, that otherwise have to consider the tab separators, which can be a little cumbersome.
    
    FIXES: https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/issues/1196
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: `itemSelect` is renamed to `tabSelect` and the `item` event param is renamed to `tab`.
