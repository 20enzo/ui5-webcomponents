    * feat(ui5-datetime-picker): introduce new component
    
    Background
    The DateTimePicker component alows users to select both date (day, month and year) and time (hours, minutes and seconds).
    The component opens a popover with calendar and time controls.
    On smaller screen and on phone device there is a switch to change between the calendar and time controls.
    Technical points
    - extends DatePicker
    - reuses the DatePicker template and WheelSlider component
    - refactors the DatePicker to make it more extensible and overwrite few methods
    - extracts time related functions
