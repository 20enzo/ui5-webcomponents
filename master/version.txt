    refactor(ui5-list): clicking inactive items doesn't change selection (#1183)
    
    Previously, clicking on list items with type="Inactive" in a List used to change selection in "SingleSelect" and "MultiSelect" modes.
    Now,  clicking on inactive items would not take effect. To change the selection you have to use list items with type="Active".
