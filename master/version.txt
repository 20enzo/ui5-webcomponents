    fix(ui5-timepicker, ui5-duration-picker):  enable  width customization (#1669)
    
    Several issues has been resolved with this change:
    - the input field now expands together with the host tag
    - the Popover with the time sliders remains the same, when the input gets bigger
    - the TimePicker on phone used to have a header with a close button that is not supposed to be displayed,
    the component has a cancel button in the footer, this default header is meant for other components.
