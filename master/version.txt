    chore(ui5-fcl): add template hooks for toggle arrows (#2242)
    
    Add template hooks for the toggle arrows of thew FlexibleColumnLayout,
    so that a derived class can fully customize them.
    For example: provide different or new ARIA attribbutes or change the values of existing ones.
    Note: We considered providing slots or proeprties,
    but we wanted to keep the API more simple and aggreed on this solution.
