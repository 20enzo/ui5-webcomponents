     fix(ui5-input): Fix JS error thrown in IE (#2022)
    
    For some reason the statement "this.responsivePopover.querySelectorAll("ui5-list>*") always returns an empty array in IE, later leading to a JS error, when element from that array had to be accessed, so I had to tweak it a little bit.
    
    FIXES: #2019
