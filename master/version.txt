    refactor(ui5-input): improve group suggestion item handling (#1343)
    
    Couple of improvements in handling a group item within the suggestion popover:
    - When navigating via the keyboard over a group item, the text in the input field should be cleared
    - However, the group item should also have the selection visual, when reached via the keyboard, but it can not be selected neither with the keyboard, nor with a click
