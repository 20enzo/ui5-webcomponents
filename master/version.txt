    refactor(ui5-popover): Keep popup open if focus is inside (#1937)
    
    Another PR to address the "QuickCardView" topic. The change keeps the Popover open, without an opener, if the focus is inside that popover.
    
    add prevent-focus-restore protected property in addition to the preventFocusRestore param of Popup.prototype.close method, because the quickCardView might close due to user interaction - click, TAB, ESC.
    remove the recently added _closeWithOpener param, as now the popover without an opener would remain open if the focus is inside it and will be closed otherwise.
    QuickCardView Interaction (test it on http://localhost:8080/test-resources/pages/Input_quickview.html)
    
    Once opened, both Suggestions Popover and QuickCardView will close if:
    neither the SearchField nor the QuickCardView has the focus, because the user clicks somewhere outside or
    the user uses the TAB | SHIFT + TAB and the focus is somewhere else
    
    Once opened, the QuickCardView remains open and Suggestions Popover closes if:
    the focus moves to the QuickCardView, because the Popover.prototype.applyFocus method is called,
    the user clicks inside the QuickCardView or the user uses the TAB | SHIFT + TAB key and the focus is goes inside the QuickCardView
    
    Closes: #1768
