    chore: map dist to src for VSCode navigation (#933)
    
    VS code reads the jsconfig.json file and the paths mapping.
    
    This enables CMD-click on a module in @ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/ to navigate to the src folder of the monorepo instead of the dist folder where any edits would be lost.
