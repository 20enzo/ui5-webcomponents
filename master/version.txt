    chore(ui5-rating-indicator): enable aria-label and tooltip (#1822)
    
    Add private aria-label and title props so the user can set them outside and ensure default tooltip ("Rating") is present when title is not provided, as elements with role="slider" needs aria-label, aria-labelledby or tooltip.
    A default aria-label was not an option as the word "Rating" would have been read twice as aria-roledescription="Rating Indicator" is already set.
