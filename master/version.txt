    feat(ui5-icon): change src property to name (#928)
    
    BREAKING CHANGE:
    @ui5/webcomponents/dist/Icon.js
    The src property was renamed to name and accepts icon name (such as "add") instead of icon src (such as "sap-icon://add").
    Note: the src property will continue to work until the next release due to the impact of the change, but will produce a warning in the console.
    
    @ui5/webcomponents/dist/Card.js
    The avatar property was removed.
    Use the avatar slot instead - pass an icon(<ui5-icon) or an image(<img).
    Before:
    <ui5-card avatar="sap-icon://add"></ui5-card>
    After:
    <ui5-card><ui5-icon name="add" slot="avatar"></ui5-icon></ui5-card>
    and respectively:
    <ui5-card avatar="http://url/to/my/image"></ui5-card>
    becomes:
    <ui5-card><img src="http://url/to/my/image" slot="avatar"/></ui5-card>
    
    @ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/ShellBarItem.js
    The src property was renamed to icon and accepts icon name (such as "add") instead of icon src (such as "sap-icon://add")
