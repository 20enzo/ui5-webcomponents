    chore: use theming-base-content for --sap* CSS vars (#1399)
    
    We used to provide a subset of all --sap* variables (the ones our components need), provided by `@sap-theming/theming-base-content` project and respectively generated from the `ThemeDesigner.`
    However, our users might need some of these variables we don't use and provide and **we agreed on switching to `@sap-theming/theming-base-content` as a source for all theme parameters** and thus having all the parameters available for the users of the`@ui5/webcomponents`
    
    FIXES: https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/issues/1396
