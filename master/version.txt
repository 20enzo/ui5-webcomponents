    fix(ui5-tabcontainer): fix overflow item default semantic color (#989)
    
    This is a follow up of Follow up of: #988 where overflow items appearance in negative, positive and critical states have been fixed. However, I missed the default semantic appearance.
    Now the default semantic appearance of the overflow item text and icon in active state also looks correct.
