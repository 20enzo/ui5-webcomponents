    fix: fix JS error on setLanguage call (#2328)
    
    When there is a component that uses CLDR and someone calls **setLanguage**,
    this causes the webcomponents to re-render and recalculate their state and it turns out that the CLDR for the newly set language is missing and JS error is thrown ("Error: CLDR data for locale de is not loaded").
    Currently, this can be seen in our "RTL.html" page, if we add a DatePicker and then use the buttons on the page to change the language. This PR ensures that upon setLanguage, the CLDR is fetched/updated before the re-rendering.
    On the other hand, there is **applyDirection** API that also force re-rendering, that if used together with setLanguage, should wait for the setLanguage to complete to allow the message bundles (although they won't fail with JS error) and CLDR to load.
