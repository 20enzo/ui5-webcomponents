    chore(ui5-input): change event detail (#1820)
    
    In order to be more consistent with similar cases, when the user needs to open a popover from internal popover, as in the Shellbar, we provide the real DOM ref to an item (ui5-li) as "targetRef" param in the event detail and leave "item" param for the external ui5-suggestion-item the user set.
