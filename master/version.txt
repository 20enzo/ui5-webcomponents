    fix(ui5-input): stop firing focusout on suggestion click (#1857)
    
    The "focusout" event used to be fired whenever the user interacts with the suggestion lists, misleading the ones that listens for the event, that the user has clicked somewhere outside. Now, it is not fired.
    
    Fixes: #1846
