    feat(ui5-datepicker): Add property to hide week numbers (#1955)
    
    Add new property to DatePicker, Calendar and DayPicker, called "hideWeekNumbers' to optionally hide the weeks numbers column. (In classic UI5 there is property "showWeekNumbers, default: true" in the Calendar, but not in the DatePicker).
    Note: For calendars other than Gregorian, the week numbers are not displayed regardless of what is set.
    
    Fixes: #1949
