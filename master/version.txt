    fix(ui5-shellbar): fix search field behavior (#1264)
    
    - fix: search field suggestions popup used to open in the left most corner
    - fix: clicking on suggestions did not take effect due to pop up reposition
    
    Root cause: the search field used to close upon interaction with the items in the popover, forcing the popover to reposition itself without knowing the DOM ref of  its opener.
    
    Solution: the search field is now toggled only by clicking the search icon.
