    feat(framework): make icons RTL aware (#1833)
    
    Currently all icons are mirrored in RTL, but some of the icons should not be mirrored in RTL. The best example is the "accept" icon (checkmark) which does not make sense when mirrored. Now we keep info as "ltr" field in the SAP-Icons.json, which means an icon should remain as it is in RTL, or in other words it is always LTR. We can call the field differently in the SVGRegistry if we want - suppressMirroring, noMirror. I named it "ltr" everywhere for now.
    
    FIXES: #1831
