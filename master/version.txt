    chore: enable npm @next tag version release (#1122)
    
    **Background**
    So far in npm we have stable versions, such as `1.0.0-rc.3, 1.0.0-rc.4, 1.0.0-rc.5`.
    Now, we decided to release intermediate versions on demand as a preview with `@next` tag,
    that would look like: `0.0.0-{hash}`
    
    **How to install it**
    To get the last published version under the 'next' tag,
     you need to append `@next` as below:
    ```js
    npm install @ui5/webcomponents@next
    ```
    Without the tag, as you usually install dependencies,
    you get the latest released and stable version
    ```js
    npm install @ui5/webcomponents
    ```
