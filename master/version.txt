    refactor(icons): flatten dist directory (#2425)
    
    Change the distribution path of all individual `icons`, which changes all icons' public imports, by bringing the icons modules one level up and removing the additional "icons" folder:
    ```js
    import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/accept.js";
    ```
    
    BREAKING_CHANGE: All icons imports are changed. The individual icons modules are available in the icon package's "dist" folder. If you previously had `import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/icons/accept.js"`, now it becomes `import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/accept.js";`
