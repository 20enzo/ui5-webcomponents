    fix(ui5-shellbar): fix search field focus handling (#1636)
    
    **Issue**: the valueStateMsg popover does not show up when the user clicks on the search icon.
    **Root cause**: the ShellBar uses a timeout to focus the input to ensure it is displayed and ready to be focused, but sometimes the timeout executes too late.
    - First, the Iinput checks (onAfterRendering) if it should show a valueStateMessage and one of the requirements is to be on focus, which is still false (the timeout is called later) and does not show the popover.
    - Then, the timeout is called, moves the focus to the input, but it does not trigger re-rendering and the popover does not show up.
    **Solution:** update the state (Input "focused" property) immediately, keep the focus move delayed.
